These scripts may only useful on the NetDISK Power 400T from IOCELL Networks if
you change the operating system to a full fledged Linux based distro.
They might possibly be helpful on a system with BIOSTAR I94GC-I7 motherboard.
Unfortunately, they only affects the entire set of lamps.
It will not distinguish between devices, but cause them all to 
blink if any issue is detected.

The scripts and setled binary perform the following functions:

* Turn off the red led lamps when the system is booted.
* Alert by blinking for 15 seconds if a raid is recovering.
* Alert by turning on for 5 seconds three times if a raid is degraded.
 
Prequisites seem to be only the proper 32 bit libraries for setled.

yum -y install glibc.i686
